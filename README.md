## Description

This Library Management System (LMS) is a comprehensive and efficient application developed using JavaFX for the graphical user interface (GUI), Java for backend logic, CSS for styling, and MySQL for data storage. The system provides a full suite of functionalities for both administrators and users, enhancing the experience of managing and accessing library resources.

### Key Features:

1. **Admin and User Interfaces:**
   - The system is divided into two distinct interfaces: one for **Administrators** and another for **Users**.
   - **Admin Interface:** Allows admins to manage users, books, and system settings.
   - **User Interface:** Provides users with the ability to browse books, read reviews, rate books, and participate in entertainment features.

2. **User Management:**
   - **Admin:** Can create, modify, and delete user accounts, as well as track user activity, borrowing history, and ratings.
   - **Users:** Have personal accounts to borrow books, leave reviews, rate books, and interact with others.

3. **Book Management:**
   - Admins can add, update, delete, and categorize books in the library catalog.
   - Books can be searched by title, author, genre, or keywords.
   - Users can view detailed book information, including ratings and reviews from other users.

4. **Book Ratings and Reviews:**
   - Users can leave reviews and rate books.
   - Admins have the ability to manage and moderate reviews to ensure appropriateness and quality.
   - The **rating system** helps users make informed decisions about which books to read.

5. **Entertainment Section:**
   - The **Game Section** offers users a fun way to engage with the platform, featuring quizzes, trivia, and mini-games related to books and reading.
   - Users can also interact with a **Chatbot**, which offers book recommendations, answers questions, and provides entertainment through casual conversation.

6. **Trending and Recommendations:**
   - **Trending Books:** Displays the most popular or newly borrowed books on the platform, giving users insight into the current trends in the library.
   - **Book Recommendations:** Users will receive book suggestions based on their reading history, ratings, and preferences. The system makes recommendations without AI integration, tailoring them based on user activity.

7. **MySQL Database Integration:**
   - MySQL is used to store and manage data such as user accounts, book information, ratings, reviews, and game scores.
   - **Data Security:** Secure login authentication ensures that user data is protected.
   - **Real-time Updates:** The system ensures real-time updates in the database to reflect changes in book availability, user activity, and system settings.

### Technology Stack:
- **Frontend:** JavaFX for building the GUI, styled with CSS for a modern and intuitive user experience.
- **Backend:** Java for implementing core functionalities like user and book management, searching, ratings, and reviews.
- **Database:** MySQL for managing and storing data persistently, including user data, book catalog, ratings, and game scores.
- **Chatbot:** A chatbot to interact with users, provide book recommendations, answer questions, and engage in casual conversation.
